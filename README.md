### Hi there, I'm Zeyuan Wang ðŸ‘‹

As a software developer at AssignRef, I built user-friendly and data-driven web applications using React, SQL, and .Net Core. I designed and implemented front-end components, back-end services, and database schemas that met the functional and performance requirements of the clients. I also used Postman to test and debug complex API requests and responses, and ensured data validation and security on both client and server sides.

Before joining AssignRef, I served as a behavioral health technician in the US Army for three years, where I counseled and assisted patients with various psychological and substance abuse issues. I received multiple honors for my dedication and professionalism, including the Army Achievement Medal and the Army Certificate of Achievement. I also have a bachelor's degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Texas A&M University, where I participated in a low-cost solar project as a research assistant.

I am currently pursuing my master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California, where I am expanding my knowledge and skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to real-world problems. I am seeking new opportunities to collaborate with other developers and create innovative and impactful solutions for the software industry.
